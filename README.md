# Introduction
Interactive e-commerce product page with real-time 3D preview and customization, built with Next.js, React, Three.js and Tailwind CSS.

Users can explore a product through a dynamic landing page, navigate animated sections, and preview a customizable mechanical keyboard rendered in 3D. The application focuses on performance, modular UI architecture, and smooth user experience.

The project combines traditional front-end development with real-time graphics to demonstrate how 3D visualization can enhance product presentation in web-based e-commerce.

This project is a front-end focused prototype and does not include backend logic, authentication, or payments.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
